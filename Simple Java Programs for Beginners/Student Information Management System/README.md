# **Student Information Management System**
## Author: Thomas Lee
This project simulates a student information management system where studentsâ€™ details can be stored, searched, and updated.

## Project Overview
This Java-based system allows:
- Storing and retrieving student information (ID, name, gender, birthdate, major)
- Searching for students by name or ID
- Updating a student's major
- Handling exceptions when a student is not found

## Programs Included
### 1. Student.java
- Defines a **Student** class that includes:
  - Attributes: ID, name, gender, date of birth, and major
  - Getters and setters for student attributes
  - Methods for searching students by ID or name
  - A method for changing a student's major
  - A **toString()** method for displaying student details


### 2. RewardsAccount.java
- Simulates a simple student database system:
  - Reads student data from a file (**studentInfo.txt**)
  - Displays student information
  - Provides a menu for searching by ID, searching by name, or changing a major
  - Demonstrates all functionalities of the Student class

### 3. StudentNotFoundException.java
- Custom exception class to handle cases where a student is not found in the system.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Java installed (**java -version** to check).
2. Compile the programs:
```
javac Student.java StudentApplication.java StudentNotFoundException.java
```
3. Run the test program:

```
4. Follow the menu options to search for students or update their major.
